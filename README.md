# Chatterbot

This is a chatterbot project that I may implement into a physical computing project in the future.

The project itself is written in C++.

The inspiration for this project came from the movie 'Her', starring Joaquin Pheonix. I viewed the idea of having a robot that can react and respond correctly to what you tell it as something that is not too outlandish and could be used in the future. Academic literature, namely from Noam Chomsky and Claude Shannon, gave me a springboard to leap headfirst into the project.

I would like to see this implemented into a physical computing/tangible interface project. I think this could provide a sense of closeness and comfort to someone who is alone and could use it, similar to Samantha in 'Her'.




Thank you, Joaquin Pheonix.
